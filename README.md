# MVC_CRUD_BASIC
This is a simple project to illustrate how MVC pattern work and what components it consists of

## Introduction
MVC Pattern stands for Model-View-Controller Pattern
MVC pattern contains three main components, each responsible for different things

* the Controller ->  Controller acts on both the model and view. It controls the data flow into model object and updates the view whenever data changes.
                     It keeps view and model separate
* the Model -> represents an object, it can also have logic to update controller if its data changes
* the View -> represents the visualization of the data that model contains



### CRUD

For better understanding, those components and how MVC work I use this basic CRUD(create, read, update, delete ) application
It was written in Python 3.5, so if you are using python 2.7 you need to apply some changes
